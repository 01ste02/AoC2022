# AoC2022
I am doing AdventOfCode 2022, and trying to stick with bash for as long as possible. ~~As of writing this (Day 4), I have not had any days have a runtime of over 30ms - if you exclude time for debug printing to stdin.~~ This was true until day 8 where I got execution times of 30 to 50 seconds. While they could have been reduced to probably 15 and 30, I think I might have found a limitation of single-threaded bash..

As a backup-language I am thinking python. But I will probably stick to bash.

I realized that my commit-messages are a bit of a comedy show around day 6, so they will be appended below every day for your entertainment (although I do not know who would really care enough to look at this repo except for fnurkla and Bäcker so far..):

 * AOC day one, sorted stars. Will Advent of Bash be a thing? ~ *Oh, how naive I was.. It will definetly be a thing. A slow and torturous thing.*
 * Day 2. Still advent of bash - and apparantly there is a difference between the win-order of Sten Sax Påse and Rock Paper Scissors... Who knew..? ~ *Still adjusting to the 5:45 wakeup-time.. Languages and translations of things that are automatic are not so simple at 6AM apparently..*
 * Advent of bash going strong. Not much to say today other than garbage in = garbage out ~ *Ah, the first REAL round of parsing...*
 * Day 4: Still Advent of Bash, went smoothly. Interesting to create ranges from limits and then try to iterate over arrays and find matches - easier in bash than I imagined ~ *Not much to say, but iterating over arrays is still interesting. And SLOW.*
 * Day5: Advent of Bash is getting hard. This problem could have been solved MUCH quicker by any list class, but the lists in bash lack methods for operations on elements. So I basically made it. First with sed - which was buggy since crates were not unique and sed removed all crates with a specific insignia. Then I made it with bash comprehensions - MUCH faster and easier to understand. Also solves the bugs with sed. ~ *Another visit from naive me.. That was not really hard. Although a list with take-operations would be nice. Also, I hate sed. Hate it, and the people who can write it from memory. But I can write most sed-queries from memory due to using it so much at work - this day I did not have to look up the correct syntax even. So I might hate myself (?)... *
 * Day 6. Advent of Bash much easier than yesterday... Turns out that bash is really good at sliding-window iterations and comparisons. Quite quick and effective still... ~ *Ah, how happy I was. The sliding-windows were fun and fast though*
 * Day 7. Advent of Bash going strong - but I will start slipping down from place 12 now. It took me 20 minutes to sort and find the smallest directory needed. Bash has limitations in places I do not like to admit, but it works. I'll be damned if it doesn't work. It still feels like a good idea and experience to write these challenges in bash - even though the language is not really made for it - but the portability of it is amazing. No compiler to install, and can run on most systems by default. I believe that all my solutions so far would be sh-compatible as well.. ~ *Starting to get stubborn. Stupid, but quite good sometimes IMO. Had an argument with people over why bash is the best. I **definitely** won that fight. *
 * Day 8. This day took a while. Not to code, but to execute. Part one took about 30 seconds, with 5 or 10 of them to print progress to stdout. Part 2 took about 50 seconds with the same print times. This sollution was probably horribly inefficient, but was the best I could come up with given the limitations of bash. It would probably be more efficient to build anouther array with the forest rotated 90 degrees for doing top and bottom lookups. This could at least save a lot of time in part 2. ~ *Will update this comment tomorrow, I am currently too mad that I did not think of rotating the forest 90 degrees instead of basically doing it lots of times for every tree I wanted to check visibility for *
