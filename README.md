# AoC2022
I am doing AdventOfCode 2022, and trying to stick with bash for as long as possible. As of writing this (Day 4), I have not had any days have a runtime of over 30ms - if you exclude time for debug printing to stdin.

As a backup-language I am thinking python. But I will probably stick to bash.
